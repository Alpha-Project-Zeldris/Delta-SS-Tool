This repository contains the source code for the public release of the Delta SS Tool. This tool detects cheaters in minecraft using a variety of different techniques. This project is **not** readily compileable and will take a lot of work to be able to fork your own version. It only serves to be an example for a successful SS Tool.

### Usage

Download the tool from the main discord in channel #ss-bot

### Adding the Discord Bot

[Discord Permissions](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=414310352709484555&scope=bot&permissions=68608 "Delta-Bot")

Add the bot to your discord server and create a channel titled ``ss-bot``. Delta-Bot needs access to read and send messages in that channel to correctly function. To test if the bot has been added properly, use the command ``!deltahelp``.
