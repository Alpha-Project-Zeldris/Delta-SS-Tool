# String Analyzer

## Introduction

> This tool analyzes string dumps from processhacker to identify strings that can be used to identify cheats. I'm releasing it free of charge because people think creating pasted SS tools makes them cool and unique, when really most of them just copy from leaked code66 or write some horendous garbage like the Ostia PvP tool I cracked in 4 seconds.

## Code Samples

> Just read the source code.

## Installation

> ![Setup Dir](https://i.imgur.com/oNFph5b.png)

> Load all the ph2 dumps of clean into the clean folder, whatever dumps when a cheat is running into dirty, then run the program. This requires a little bit of brainpower, so don't open an issue because you're too stupid to figure it out.
