# SS Tool

## Introduction

> This folder contains 95% of the source code for the Delta SS Tool. The only things omitted is our authentication logic in official releases, however it contains plenty enough for anyone with a little bit of intuition to be able to perform edits and/or write their own flavor of this tool. Keep in mind that this repository is licensed under GPL v3 so any fork must be open sourced as well.

## Code Samples

> Just read the source code.

## Installation

> There is no support to forks or "unofficial" builds of this tool. If you are not a developer, please only use the official releases. 

> Instructions will be added later on how to add the bot to your discord server and setup the channel, for now join [![Delta Games](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chat%20%2F%20Support-discord-7289DA.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/cNwjfzw)
