# SS Tool

## Introduction

> This folder contains 95% of the source code for the Delta SS Tool. The only things omitted is our authentication logic in official releases, however it contains plenty enough for anyone with a little bit of intuition to be able to perform edits and/or write their own flavor of this tool. Keep in mind that this repository is licensed under GPL v3 so any fork must be open sourced as well.

## Code Samples

> Just read the source code.

## Installation

> There is no support to forks or "unofficial" builds of this tool. If you are not a developer, please only use the official releases.
